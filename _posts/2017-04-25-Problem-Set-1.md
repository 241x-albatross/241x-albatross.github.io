We assembled a Bixler 3 RC aircraft and flew it to perform some system identification.

In the [PDF report]({{ site.github.url }}/files/bixler-3-flight.pdf) you can find our results on system identification, as well as some preliminary thoughts towards mission planning. 

The work breakdown for this assignment can be found in [this document]({{ site.github.url }}/files/pset1-contribution.docx).
